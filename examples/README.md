Welcome to the Examples
=======================

This package includes a few sets of examples:
* "Paper": Examples from the paper. If you're looking to reproduce a figure from the paper, look here.
* "Programmatic Interface": Examples that show how to use the surface_crn package within python. This lets you do things like run headless simulations (no graphics) and swap out features like the simulator algorithm or underlying grid geometry. 
* "Other": A few other fun examples that didn't make it into the paper.
